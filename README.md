# 100daysOfJava
doing a 100 days of code with java

no specific plan but I'll do a rundown of what I do every day

* day 1 05/05/2022 Java program to read text from one file and output it each word on a new line in console as well as different implementations of it and a file writer program to put results into a text file
* day 2 06/05/2022 Started doing a match 3 game didn't have enough time to finish today will continue tomorrow
* day 3 07/05/2022 Game is ready to play in console, worked out better than expected
* day 4 08/05/2022 Today I decided to focus on data structures, namely Arrays and Stacks solving questions for them in GeeksForGeeks and some problems in LeetCode
* day 5 09/05/2022 Hate to admit it, but I've done nothing... But I had a nice family dinner. Next day is going to be better:)
* day 6 10/05/2022 Was catching up on LeetCode
* day 7 11/05/2022 Catch up on LeetCode
* day 8 12/05/2022 Catch up on LeetCode don't have a lot of time during the week so I will practice more on the weekend
